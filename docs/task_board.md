---

## Phase 8: Name Preservation Enhancement ✅
### 8.1 Sanitization Adjustments ✅
- [x] Modify `sanitizeName` to preserve original capitalization and spaces while still removing invalid filesystem characters **(implemented via new `sanitizeOriginalName`)**
- [x] Ensure `generateUniqueName` remains compatible with the updated `sanitizeName` **(added new `generateUniqueOriginalName`)**
- [x] Add unit tests to validate new sanitization behavior

### 8.2 Command Updates ✅
- [x] Update `postman_parser` to adopt the new sanitization logic
- [x] Update `split_command` to write folders and requests using the preserved names
- [x] Update `build_command` (if necessary) to correctly reconstruct collections with original names **(build works correctly with new names)**

### 8.3 Test Suite Updates ✅
- [x] Update existing unit tests that assert snake_case names (no changes required; added new tests instead)
- [x] Revise integration tests to expect original names in generated file structures **(verified working)**
- [x] Run the full test suite and ensure all tests pass **(114 tests passing)**

### 8.4 Documentation ✅
- [x] Keep this task board up to date with progress 
- [x] Real-world testing completed with complex Levo collection **(verified folders like "Activity [Internal]", "v1", "Platform v1.2" preserve original names)**
- [x] CLI round-trip testing completed **(split → build cycle works perfectly)**

### 8.5 Enhanced Features Delivered ✅
- [x] **Original Name Preservation**: Folders and files now use human-readable names like "Create Single.json" instead of "create_single.json"
- [x] **Improved Duplicate Handling**: Duplicates use natural format like "Media (1)" instead of "Media_1"
- [x] **Bracket Preservation**: Special characters like brackets in "Activity [Internal]" are preserved
- [x] **Version Format Preservation**: Version strings like "v1", "v1.2" maintain their original formatting 

---

## Phase 9: Scoped Duplicate Detection Fix ✅
### 9.1 Issue Identification ✅
- [x] **Problem**: Folders with same names at different hierarchy levels were incorrectly treated as duplicates (e.g., "v1" folders under different parents became "v1", "v1 (1)", "v1 (2)" instead of staying as "v1" in each parent scope)
- [x] **Root Cause**: Global `existing_names` Set in PostmanParser was accumulating names across entire collection instead of scoping to parent folder level

### 9.2 Implementation ✅
- [x] **Scoped Duplicate Detection**: Modified `processItem` method to use local sibling scopes instead of global name tracking
- [x] **Parameter Addition**: Added `sibling_names` parameter to `processItem` for parent-level duplicate detection
- [x] **Recursive Scoping**: Each folder level now maintains its own Set of sibling names for proper duplicate detection
- [x] **Root Level Handling**: Updated `parseCollection` to handle root-level items with their own sibling scope

### 9.3 Results ✅
- [x] **Proper Naming**: Folders like "v1" under different parents (Platform/v1, Insights/v1, etc.) now keep original names
- [x] **Correct Duplicates**: Only true duplicates at same level get numbered (e.g., two "v1" folders at root level become "v1" and "v1 (1)")
- [x] **Natural Format**: Duplicate numbering uses parentheses format "Name (1)" instead of underscore "Name_1"
- [x] **Bracket Preservation**: Special characters like "Activity [Internal]" are preserved correctly

### 9.4 Testing ✅
- [x] **Unit Tests**: All existing tests continue to pass (114/114)
- [x] **Integration Testing**: Round-trip conversion works perfectly with real Levo collection
- [x] **Real-world Validation**: Tested with complex nested collection showing proper folder naming
- [x] **CLI Verification**: Command-line interface works correctly with new scoped naming

### 9.5 Quality Assurance ✅
- [x] **No Regressions**: All existing functionality preserved
- [x] **Performance**: No performance impact from scoped duplicate detection
- [x] **Code Quality**: Clean implementation with proper parameter handling
- [x] **Documentation**: Code comments updated to reflect scoped behavior
